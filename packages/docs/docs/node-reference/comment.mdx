## Overview

The Comment Node is a special type of node that doesn't perform any operations but serves as a way to add notes or comments to a graph. It can be used to provide additional context or explanation for a group of nodes, making the graph easier to understand. The Comment Node is always rendered behind other nodes and has a distinct appearance with customizable colors.

A comment node is always rendered behind all other nodes in the graph.

## Example Usage

The Comment Node can be used to add notes or comments to a graph. For example, if you have a group of nodes performing a specific operation, you can add a Comment Node behind them to provide a brief explanation of what they do.

Additionally, you can use different colors for the text and background of different Comment Nodes to visually distinguish between different sections of your graph.
