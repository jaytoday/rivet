The AssemblyAI plugin has a dedicated node for each LeMUR endpoint.
Each node accepts Transcript IDs as input which you can get from the Transcribe Audio Node. Additional parameters are available as inputs and as node configuration. For more information what these parameters do, [check out the LeMUR API reference](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/lemur).
