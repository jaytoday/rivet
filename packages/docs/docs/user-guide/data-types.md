# Data Types

Internally, the data the passes through Rivet is marked as a number of data types. When integrating Rivet with your own application, you will need to know what these data types are and how to handle them.

## DataValue

A DataValue is a value that can be passed through Rivet. It is a union of all the possible data types that can be passed through Rivet. It is represented as an object with a `type` property and a `value` property. The `type` key is in the table below, except when additional type decorators are present on the type.

## Decorators

A type may have the following decorators applied to it, which change the type. Decorators can be combined on a type name, for example a type can be `fn<string[]>`. Valid decorators are:

| Decorator  | Description                                                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[]`       | The type is an array of the type before the brackets.                   |
| `fn<type>` | The type is a function that returns the type inside the angle brackets. |

## Types

| Type                    | Description                                                                                             | TypeScript Type                                                            | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `any`                   | A special type of data that can store _anything_.                                                       | `unknown`                                                                  | Often, the value contained will be attempted to be either inferred based on the JavaScript type of the value, or it will be attempted to be coerced into a desired data type. Avoid using `any` in most cases, especially when you already know the type of a value. |
| `boolean`               | A boolean true or false.                                                                                | `boolean`                                                                  | Equivalent to the JavaScript `boolean` type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
